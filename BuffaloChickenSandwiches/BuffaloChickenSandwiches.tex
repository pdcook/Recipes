\instructions
Procure a crock pot with at least $1$ gallon capacity.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chop or dice the onion and green bell peppers to desired size and finely mince or crush the garlic.
    \item Combine all the ingredients for the buffalo chicken in the crock pot---except for the butter.
    \item Cook on low for $7$ to $9$ hours, until internal temperature of the chicken reaches \temp{165}.
    \item Once cooked, shred the chicken. This can be done either with two forks or a large spaghetti spoon.
    \item Add the butter to the shredded chicken and mix gently until completely melted.
    \item To serve, toast hoagie rolls. Optionally, melt cheese and pepper onto rolls while toasting. Pile buffalo chicken on rolls and add any additional toppings.
    \item If desired, keep buffalo chicken sealed in fridge for up to a week. Reheat covered in microwave, prepare sandwich as before.
