\instructions
Preheat oven to \temp{350}. Procure a $9~\mathrm{in.}\times9~\mathrm{in.}$ baking pan and line with parchment paper or spray with nonstick cooking spray.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a large mixing bowl, combine the wet ingredients for the cake and mix well.
    \item In a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients for the cake and mix well.
    \item Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring constantly as they are added. Mix until just combined.
    \item Set aside the batter.
    \item In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the cinnamon sugar swirl and mix well.
    \item In a separate small bowl, combine the ingredients for the crumb topping. Use a fork to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. Continue until the mixture forms small clumps and has the texture of wet sand.
    \item Retrieve the batter and baking pan. Pour half the batter into the pan and wait for it to settle evenly. Spread the cinnamon sugar swirl over the layer of batter, then pour the remaining batter over the cinnamon sugar. Finally, evenly spread the crumble topping over the top.
    \item Bake for $45$ to $55$ minutes, until a knife inserted comes out mostly clean. Allow to cool before serving. Store in fridge for up to a week. Reheats well when covered in microwave.
