\ingredients
\begin{itemize}
    \item $26$ grams salted butter
    \item $20$ grams white granulated sugar
    \item $60$ grams milk
    \item $50$ grams all purpose flour
    \item $1/2$ tsp baking powder
    \item $1/4$ tsp vanilla extract (optional)
\end{itemize}

\instructions
Procure a $12$ fl.\ oz., microwave safe coffee mug and a sufficiently precise digital scale. For best results, the measurements in this recipe must be followed very precisely.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add the butter to the mug and microwave until completely melted---about 40 seconds in a $1000$ W microwave.
    \item Add all other ingredients to the mug and mix until just combined. Do not over mix.
    \item Separate batter from the mug by scraping the bottom and sides with a rubber spatula.
    \item Tap mug on counter once or twice to settle the batter.
    \item Microwave uncovered for 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds. Do not overcook.
    \item Let cool and then serve hot, optionally with honey, maple syrup, or butter on top.
\end{enumerate}
